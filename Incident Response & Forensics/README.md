# ðŸš¨ Incident Response & Forensics

This section demonstrates my ability to detect, contain, and remediate cybersecurity incidents using formal **Incident Response (IR)** methodologies such as **NIST SP 800-61** and **ISO/IEC 27035**.  
Each deliverable focuses on preparation, detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned â€” simulating a complete incident lifecycle.

## ðŸ“„ Projects Included

### 1. **Incident Report Analysis â€“ DDoS Attack**
**Goal:** Document and analyze a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack to assess business impact and response readiness.  
**Highlights:**
- Captured network flood signatures and service downtime logs.  
- Identified source IP clusters and mitigation actions.  
- Aligned incident phases with NIST IR lifecycle.  

---

### 2. **Network Traffic Analysis Report**
**Goal:** Investigate network logs for evidence of suspicious communication or data exfiltration.  
**Highlights:**
- Analyzed PCAP data and firewall logs for anomalies.  
- Identified excessive ICMP/DNS requests from rogue IPs.  
- Provided packet-level forensic evidence and recommendations.  

---

### 3. **Incident Response Playbooks (Phishing, Ransomware, Insider Threat)**
**Goal:** Create standardized **SOPs** for common attack types to reduce Mean Time to Respond (MTTR).  
**Highlights:**
- Step-by-step containment, eradication, and recovery instructions.  
- Communication templates for SOC analysts and stakeholders.  
- Preventive controls: sandboxing, MFA, user education.  

---

### 4. **Final Incident Report â€“ E-Commerce Data Breach**
**Goal:** Perform post-incident review of a simulated data breach impacting customer PII.  
**Highlights:**
- Root cause: outdated CMS plugin exploited for forced browsing.  
- Timeline reconstruction with containment and recovery efforts.  
- Recommendations: patch management, SIEM alerts, encryption enforcement.  

---

## ðŸ§­ Key Outcomes
- Demonstrated complete understanding of **incident management lifecycle**.  
- Developed **playbooks** and **final reports** for recurring threats.  
- Strengthened SOC coordination, documentation, and forensic analysis processes.  
- Aligned deliverables with **NIST 800-61**, **ISO 27035**, and **SANS IR best practices**.
