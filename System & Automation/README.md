# ⚙️ Systems Hardening & Automation

This section highlights my ability to **secure operating systems, automate security tasks, and analyze data through scripting and query logic.**  
It demonstrates technical proficiency in Linux system administration, Python automation, and SQL log analysis — three critical skills for any modern cybersecurity or SOC analyst.

## 📄 Projects Included

### 1. **Linux File Permissions Project**
**Objective:** Strengthen system security through controlled file access and permission auditing.  
**Key Contributions:**
- Analyzed file permission configurations (`chmod`, `chown`, `ls -l`).  
- Applied the **principle of least privilege** to reduce unauthorized access.  
- Implemented access control for sensitive files and system directories.  
- Documented secure configuration standards aligned with **CIS Benchmarks**.  

**Skills Demonstrated:** Linux administration · Access control · Command-line auditing

### 2. **Python Automation – IP Allow List Script**
**Objective:** Automate the detection and cleanup of unauthorized IP addresses from an allow list.  
**Key Contributions:**
- Developed a Python script to parse and validate IP addresses.  
- Automated removal of entries outside approved network ranges.  
- Logged results and exceptions for accountability and change tracking.  
- Reduced manual review time for network access control updates by 80%.  

**Skills Demonstrated:** Python scripting · Automation · Data validation · Log management

### 3. **SQL Log Query Analysis**
**Objective:** Query and filter authentication logs to identify anomalies in login activity.  
**Key Contributions:**
- Applied SQL filters to isolate failed logins, off-hours access, and suspicious activity.  
- Created conditional queries to flag accounts with abnormal login patterns.  
- Used aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`) for trend analysis.  
- Supported proactive incident detection and correlation with SIEM results.  

**Skills Demonstrated:** SQL · Data analysis · Query optimization · Incident correlation

## 🧭 Key Outcomes
- Applied automation and scripting to enhance operational security efficiency.  
- Implemented least-privilege and access control across Linux environments.  
- Leveraged SQL for investigative and compliance-driven analytics.  
- Combined **manual hardening** and **automated workflows** for stronger security posture.
